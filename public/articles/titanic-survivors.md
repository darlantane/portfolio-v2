As part of the **Data Analysis Essentials** program at **Jedha Bootcamp**, I worked on a classification project using the famous **Titanic dataset from Kaggle**. The goal? To build a predictive model that estimates whether a passenger would survive the disaster based on demographic and travel-related information.

---

## Project Overview

The Titanic dataset offers a rich snapshot of 891 passengers, detailing:

- Personal details (Name, Gender, Age)
- Ticket and travel information (Class, Fare, Cabin, Embarkation Port)
- Family size (Siblings/Spouses, Parents/Children)
- Survival status

This challenge is a classic introduction to machine learning and a great exercise in **data cleaning**, **feature engineering**, and **model evaluation**.

## Data Preparation & Cleaning

### Feature Selection
To streamline the model, we removed non-essential columns such as:

- Passenger ID  
- Name  
- Ticket Number  
- Cabin Number  

### Handling Missing Values
- Age: Replaced missing values with the **mean age**
- Embarked & Fare: Imputed using mode or median
- Categorical encoding: Converted categorical features into numerical using one-hot encoding
- Standardization: Scaled numerical values for model efficiency

---

## Model Building

We used a **Logistic Regression** model, ideal for binary classification problems like this one.  
The dataset was split into:

- **Training set (80%)**  
- **Test set (20%)**

### **Model Score:**

The model achieved **80% accuracy**, showing a solid ability to generalize from the training data.

## Key Visual Insights

### **Age Distribution by Survival Status**
Younger passengers—particularly children—had higher survival rates.

### **Embarkation Port vs Survival**

Passengers who boarded in **Cherbourg (C)** were more likely to survive.

---

### **Gender and Survival**

Clear survival bias: **females had significantly higher survival rates** than males.

---

### **Passenger Class**

Higher-class passengers (1st and 2nd class) had much better odds of surviving than those in 3rd class.

## Key Takeaways

**Gender mattered most** – being female dramatically increased survival odds  
**Class inequality** – 1st class had the highest survival rate  
**Children were prioritized** – especially those under 10  
**Boarding location** – Embarked C > Q > S in survival rate

## Technologies Used

- **Python**  
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation  
- **Seaborn** – Visualizations  
- **Scikit-learn** – Modeling
