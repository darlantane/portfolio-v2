During our first week in the **Fullstack Data Analysis program** at **Jedha Bootcamp**, our challenge was to come up with an innovative startup idea and bring it to life—conceptually and visually.

The result? **MobyDoc**: your new best friend when it comes to finding a medical appointment *quickly, easily, and stress-free*.

## 💡 The Concept

**Problem:** Long wait times and appointment unavailability when you need a doctor *now*.  
**Solution:** A streamlined app that instantly connects users to available medical consultations.

MobyDoc allows patients to **book last-minute appointments** and enables doctors to **fill unbooked slots**—a win-win!
