As part of our final project at **Jedha Bootcamp – Fullstack Data Analyst**, I had the pleasure of working with an amazing team (shoutout to Isa, Ndeye, and Yulia!) on a question many game studios would love to answer:

**What are the real ingredients behind a successful video game?**

We analyzed data from three of the biggest platforms: **Steam, PlayStation, and Xbox**, combining insights on pricing, genres, engagement, and international adoption.

## A Booming Industry

![Gaming Market Overview](/articles/illustrations/market.png)

- $184 billion generated in 2023
- 1 in 3 people on Earth play video games
- Revenues:
  - Xbox: $16B
  - Steam: $10B
  - PlayStation: $9B

## From Raw Data to Clean Insights

Analyzing video game performance across platforms means dealing with a lot of different data sources – each with its own format, structure, and quirks. Here's how we built a clean, unified dataset from the ground up.

---

### 1. Importing Raw Data from Multiple Platforms

We loaded CSV datasets from **Steam**, **PlayStation**, and **Xbox**, covering games, prices, achievements, players, history and purchased_games.

```python
games_playstation = pd.read_csv("playstation/games.csv")
games_steam = pd.read_csv("steam/games.csv")
games_xbox = pd.read_csv("xbox/games.csv")
```

This gave us a comprehensive foundation, but the schemas were inconsistent.


### 2. Adding Platform Metadata

To keep track of each game's origin, we added a `plateforme` column to key datasets:

```python
achievements_playstation['plateforme'] = 'playstation'
achievements_steam['plateforme'] = 'steam'
achievements_xbox['plateforme'] = 'xbox'
```


### 3. Removing or converting Irrelevant or Corrupted Data

We used :
- `drop_duplicates()` and `drop()` carefully to preserve valid rows while cleaning.

```python
price_without_double = prices.drop_duplicates(subset='gameid')

players.drop('nickname', axis=1, inplace=True)
```

- `fillna()` to replace empty values by 'unknown' and 'Null'.

```python
achievements = achievements.fillna({'title': 'unknown', 'description': 'unknown', 'points':'Null'})
```

- `to_datetime()` to convert date columns.

```python
prices['date_acquired'] = pd.to_datetime(arg = prices['date_acquired'],errors='coerce')
```

This step cleaned up the noise from partially scraped or incomplete rows.


### 4. Combining Datasets

We then **concatenated** datasets by theme (e.g., achievements across platforms) into unified tables:

```python
achievements = pd.concat(
    [achievements_playstation, achievements_steam, achievements_xbox],
    axis=0, ignore_index=True
)
```


### Final Result

After all these steps, you ended up with a **clean, multi-platform dataset** of over 1,500 games, fully ready for exploration across pricing, genre, geography, and platform performance.

## Genre: The DNA of a Best Seller

![Genres by Country](/articles/illustrations/genre.png)

We found that **genre plays a major role in game popularity**. While Action dominates globally, Casual and Adventure titles are regionally successful, suggesting **local preferences drive performance**.

Examples:
- *Assassin’s Creed* – Action  
- *Final Fantasy Ever Crisis* – Adventure  
- *Pinball Wicked* – Casual

---

## Price vs. Performance: The Sales Sweet Spot

![Sales vs Price](/articles/illustrations/price&perf.png)

- Cheaper games perform *extremely* well on **Steam**
- Titles around $10 can generate strong revenues
- On **PlayStation/Xbox**, premium titles ($60–70) still rule, e.g. *Red Dead Redemption 2*

**Conversion rate is highest on Steam**, proving that **affordable pricing drives volume**.

---

## The Geography of Engagement

![Title Distribution by Country](/articles/illustrations/titles_distribution.png)

The top 20 countries generate **84% of achievements**. This means:

- Engagement is highest in the **US, Germany, and Japan**
- Broad adoption = international success potential
- Cultural fit is essential to success

---

## Strategic Recommendations

![Strategic Insights](/articles/illustrations/strategic_reco.png)

Here’s what we’d recommend to game studios based on our analysis:

1. Invest in popular genres (Action, Adventure)
2. Adjust prices based on platform
3. Match platform with budget and audience
4. Target countries with high engagement
5. Prioritize multiplayer or rewarding systems

---

## Conclusion: The Next GTA VI?

![GTA V Ingredients](/articles/illustrations/success_gta.png)

If we had to **reverse-engineer the success of a game like GTA V**, the formula would be:

- Genre: Action + Adventure
- Target: US, Germany, Japan
- Price: ~$10
- Platform: Steam
