As part of our final project at **Jedha Bootcamp – Fullstack Data Analyst**, I had the pleasure of working with an amazing team (shoutout to Isa, Ndeye, and Yulia!) on a question many game studios would love to answer:

We analyzed data from three of the biggest platforms: **Steam, PlayStation, and Xbox**, combining insights on pricing, genres, engagement, and international adoption.
