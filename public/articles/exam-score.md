As part of my data analysis training, I built an interactive dashboard using Tableau to explore the factors influencing student exam results. With over **80,000 rows of student data**, this project dives into variables like stress, anxiety, sleep, motivation, study environments, and academic majors.

## 🎯 Project Objective

The goal was to **visually analyze** which behavioral and contextual factors contribute most to exam performance. I wanted the insights to be **accessible and easy to interpret**—ideal for students, educators, and academic advisors alike.

## 🗃️ Dataset Overview

- **Rows**: 80,000
- **Columns**: 31
- **Parameters studied**:
  - Exam Score
  - Anxiety Score
  - Sleep Hours
  - Stress Level
  - Motivation Level
  - Study Environment
  - Academic Major
  - Study Hours per Day

---

## 📊 Dashboard Design

I structured the Tableau dashboard into several intuitive sections:

- **Line Charts**: Track how exam scores fluctuate with anxiety, sleep, motivation, and stress.
- **Bar Charts**: Compare scores by study environment and major.
- **Layout**: All visuals are combined into a clean, interactive Tableau dashboard using containers for clarity.

## 🔍 Key Insights

1. **Less anxiety = better scores**  
   Students with lower anxiety levels performed significantly better in exams.

2. **Sleep is critical** 💤  
   Exam performance improves steadily with longer sleep duration. More sleep = higher scores.

3. **Stress has a sweet spot**  
   While extreme stress harms results, moderate levels may actually support performance.

4. **Motivation drives success** 💡  
   Students who report high motivation tend to consistently achieve higher scores.

5. **Environment matters**  
   Quiet rooms and libraries are linked to better outcomes than dorms or cafés.

6. **STEM students study more and score slightly higher**  
   Students in science and engineering majors study about **one extra hour per day** and also show slightly better performance.
